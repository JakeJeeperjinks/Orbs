# Orbs
An agario based game, open source, and built with tons of plugins.
### Update : Added version checker + Commands
### Status : Reverted back to old version; Going to try to do a slow adding on this time.

## Plugins
Look at the Client plugin for ideas on what to do for a plugin.
Right now the plugins don't have any access to the game, although you may be able to manipulate commands so you can access the player-list and change player's mass and name.
Plugins now have the ability to have their own commands, again look at the Client plugin for an example.
Plugins are basically limited to user input from the console, and hooking onto nodejs. I can't really think of some good plugin ideas, maybe a custom Client plugin, or a advanced help command plugin.

## Docs
I am currently working on the docs, although this project is time consuming and I may put off docs until I feel a good version of the game is here.

## Plans
Not much, im finding it hard to have inspiration now a days but i will try to get motivated to add collisions, borders, w feeding (I had a prototype which was part of the re-write but it wasn't very good), and spliting. These are kinda hard features since I am inexpireinced with this kind of programming and mind-set.
