# Orbs
An agario based game, open source, and built with tons of plugins.
### Status : Re-Write (Not Working) ; Re-Write Percent : %20
### Update : Added version checker
### Working Version : https://github.com/TristonStuart/Orbs/tree/70a4308a3c63f401fb17b5474ff77bca919d0ddb (Update v0.3 is the last working release. Tweeking to the npm packages locations may be made if you arent using npm and dont have some packages downloaded. I will publish a FULL working update on version 0.3, called 0.3.1, and add a link here while I work on a re-write)

## Plugins
Plugins are drag and drop. Drag the plugin's folder into the Orbs Plugins Folder. <br>
Plugins will automatically be loaded in on startup. <br>
Plugins will have full acess to the game, game engine, game physics, console, and other plugins. <br>
Plugins may make themselves Private to avoid interference from other plugins. (Good For User Data Plugins) <br>
I recommend you install plugins only featured on our plugin page and from reputable plugin makers.

## Docs
I am currently working on the docs! Expect a semi-full documentation website soon!
